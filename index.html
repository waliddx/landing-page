					i was inspired to create this game because i was a huge fan of video
					games and i always dreamed to create one, here i am i made one not
					similar to the ones i played but has quiet few similarities with them,
					overall the experience was quiet helpful ot teach me how things works
					across the world and the future of programming, and if you're inspired
					with video games you can check out my socials to get at least
					informtion on how to starts you can find different socials down below,
					happy coding.
